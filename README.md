# Spark-Random_Forest_Classifier

#### 1. Random forest classsifier was used on a dataset of 40 million rows to classify whether a dispatch is required or not. A dispatch is whether a technician would be required by predicting drop call % using weather parameters like temperature, precipitation, humidity etc.
#### 2. The data is hourly data for 5000 locations in United States for 2019. Label is 0 if dispatch is not required otherwise 1 if needed a dispatch based on the threshold drop call % which is taken as 1% here.

# Spark-Random_Forest_Classifier

#### 1. Random forest regressor was used on a dataset of 40 million rows to predict drop call % using weather parameters like temperature, precipitation, humidity etc.
#### 2. The data is hourly data for 5000 locations in United States for 2019.
#### 3. Based on the drop call %, the an appropriate action was taken for dispatch, replacement with regards to topography, network density, and cost analysis.
